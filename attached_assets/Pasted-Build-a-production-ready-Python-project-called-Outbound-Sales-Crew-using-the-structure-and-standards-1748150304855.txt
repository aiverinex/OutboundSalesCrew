Build a production-ready Python project called Outbound Sales Crew using the structure and standards from the CrewAI Marketplace template (https://github.com/crewAIInc/marketplace-crew-template). This project is intended for submission to the CrewAI Marketplace (https://marketplace.crewai.com).
🎯 Goal

Automate outbound sales by:

    Enriching lead data using job title and company

    Writing personalized cold outreach emails with OpenAI GPT

    Generating 1–2 natural follow-up messages spaced over time

⚙️ Technical Requirements

    Use openai for email generation

    Do not use mock mode — this version uses real API calls

    Parse a sample lead profile from sample_data/lead_profile.json

    Define a .env.example like:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

    Use python-dotenv to load API key in scripts

🧠 Agent Roles

    LeadResearchAgent: enriches job title + company with extra context (e.g., company size)

    EmailDraftingAgent: writes personalized sales emails using GPT

    FollowUpAgent: creates short, friendly follow-ups for non-responders

▶️ Behavior

    Read lead_profile.json with lead details.

    Enrich using company/title logic.

    Use OpenAI to generate:

        Cold email

        Follow-up #1 (after 3 days)

        Follow-up #2 (after 7 days)

    Print or save all messages.
